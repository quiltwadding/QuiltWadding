Wadding for quilting is filling the isolated quilt that adds to bulk and warmth at its layers.  The upper layer of a bedspread is the structure of the fabric and the designs created with the fabric.  The lower layer is the backrest or union of the bedspread and is also made of thinner fabric.  The average layer is where the guitor enters. 

Depending on how you want your finished quilt to look and feel, you have to choose the right wadding for your quit. For example, if you are making a quilt for a wall, thinner batting would be ideal. If you want a warm winter quilt, what you are looking for would be a taller loft wadding. Apart from that, it would be best if you also considered other factors, such as:

<h2><center><i><b>Go for white over natural</b></i></center></h2><br>

This may be a more personal preference, but always go for white wadding because of the darker flecks found in "natural" cotton. You will not want any flecks if you prefer using white wadding for quilting as such can appear on the light-coloured fabric.

<h2><center><i><b>Get polyester wadding</b></i></center></h2><br>

Polyester is cheap and vast and ideal for those who don't want cotton. It is less breathable than wool or cotton but very light and resists repeated washing and drying well. It is often used for baby quilts for this very reason, although it may not hold up even if you wait for years of use.

If you don't use your hands for quilting, you might as well think about your machine. Professional long-arm quilting machines can handle just about any batting you can buy. But if you're using a home sewing machine, you may find it easier with a lower loft, especially if your project is large. Most large cuts of batting, combined with a thicker loft, can make it a firm hold to fit the quilt basted through the neck of the machine, and that just requires trouble.

<h2><center><i><b>Go for cotton wadding</b></i></center></h2><br>

The 100% cotton filling is made from all-natural fibres and can blend well if you are using cotton fabrics for the top and back of the quilt. It can give your comforter a nice drape and make it wonderfully soft and comfortable. Cotton wadding is warm but not too hot, making it perfect for all seasons. If you have a baby or kids, such a wadding is suitable for them. Note that cotton wadding can be quite heavy, so it may not be ideal on very large quilts. The quilting stitches themselves can be done in a rather limited way. You can quilt 8-10 "separately for a softer feel in the quilt or you can quilt thickly and have a slightly more textured quilt.

<h2><center><i><b>Opt for wool material</b></i></center></h2><br>

If you are looking for another natural option, then consider wool wadding. It is lighter than cotton and has more loft, and is known for its warmth. As it's lighter, it would be perfect for those very large projects. You can make the quilting stitches more apparent if the wadding is thick. The drape of wool wadding is similar to that of cotton wadding, yet it has more volume, which gives more warmth.

<h2><center><i><b>Know the skinny on scrim</b></i></center></h2><br>

Some wadding comes with "scrim," which is a thin layer of stabiliser that gives your wadding some strength and keeps fibres from escaping and creating that dreaded beard. You have to face it towards the back of your project if you buy a <a href="https://www.doughtysonline.co.uk">quilt wadding</a>  with a scrim.

<h2><center><i><b>Choose low loft wadding</b></i></center></h2><br>

If you use your hand to quilt, choose a low loft quilt wadding. The high loft wadding makes it difficult to get past the quilt sandwich with the dipping motion that requires hand quilting. Low loft is also great for light quilts or with complex piecing techniques, where you want to present more shapes and colours than the quilt itself.

<h2><center><i><b>Get mid loft for fluffiness</b></i></center></h2><br>

It would be best to choose a mid loft quilt wadding UK manufactured if you will quilt using a regular domestic sewing machine. The rolling, folding, and manipulation required get tricky if you've got the added bulk of high loft wadding.

<h2><center><i><b>Try high loft wadding</b></i></center></h2><br>

You can showcase your quilting's shapes by opting for a high loft quilt wadding UK manufactured. Be careful, thoughâ€”the stitches themselves tend to get lost in the ditches created by quilting in high loft wadding, so if you were hoping to showcase some colourful thread, you might want to go with lower loft.

Moreover, fusible wadding is excellent for small quilting projects. You can iron it to temporarily secure it into the middle of a quilt, which will save you time basting. So to choose the right wadding for quilting, note the factors above.
